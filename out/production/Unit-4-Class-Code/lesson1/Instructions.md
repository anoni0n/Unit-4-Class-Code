# Number Guesser
Write a program that has a user guess a random secret number between 1 and 10.

Store the secret number in a variable called secretNumber and allow the user to continually input numbers until they correctly guess what secretNumber is.

Complete the method guessMyNumber that uses a while loop to ask the user for their guess and compares it against secretNumber.

For example, if secretNumber was 6, an example run of the program may look like this:

```
See if you can guess the number!
Enter your guess:
4
Try again!
Enter your guess:
3
Try again!
Enter your guess:
1
Try again!
Enter your guess:
10
Try again!
Enter your guess:
6
Correct!
```
